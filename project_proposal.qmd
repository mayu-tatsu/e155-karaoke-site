## Project Overview
This project seeks to emulate a karaoke machine by allowing a user to select from a set list of songs and displaying appropriately-timed lyrics accordingly. Once the song has finished, the project will grade the user's performance — with both a numeric score and letter grade — based on how on-pitch they are.


## Specifications
* Design allows the user to choose a song through external hardware
* Design detects input notes between A3 and roughly B5 (220 Hz to 1000 Hz)
* Design scores the user’s singing by comparing detected and expected notes
* Displays properly-timed lyrics/notes on an LCD screen
* LCD display does not flicker

Overall, the team hopes to complete the vast majority of the project's tasks together, so as to receive an equal and holistic learning experience.


## Design Details
### New MCU Functionality
The new MCU functionality intended to be used is the I2C interface peripheral, which will enable communication with the LCD.

### New FPGA Functionality
The new FPGA functionality intended to be used is decimation.
In short, decimation is a term in (digital) signal processing that describes the removal of samples so as to reduce the complexity of subsequent computations.

### New Non-Trivial Hardware
The two new, non-trivial pieces of hardware that will be used in this project are the Hoysond LCD module and the Adafruit PDM microphone.

### Riskiest Element
The riskiest element of the project will likely be integrating the aforementioned PDM to PCM decimation on the FPGA, which involves CIC and FIR filters; at the moment, the team does not know anything about this, nor how to implement it, so it is hard to assess both the amount and difficulty of the workload before actually diving into it.
It requires a decent amount of math and selectivity for it to function for the team's purposes, which they will be learning along the way. 
The team will attempt to mitigate these risks by utilizing reference designs and validating incrementally on the FPGA.
