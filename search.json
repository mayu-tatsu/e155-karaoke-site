    "text": "Design Details\n\nNew MCU Functionality\nThe new MCU functionality intended to be used is the I2C interface peripheral, which will enable communication with the LCD.\n\n\nNew FPGA Functionality\nThe new FPGA functionality intended to be used is decimation. In short, decimation is a term in (digital) signal processing that describes the removal of samples so as to reduce the complexity of subsequent computations.\n\n\nNew Non-Trivial Hardware\nThe two new, non-trivial pieces of hardware that will be used in this project are the Hoysond LCD module and the Adafruit PDM microphone.\n\n\nRiskiest Element\nThe riskiest element of the project will likely be integrating the aforementioned PDM to PCM decimation on the FPGA, which involves CIC and FIR filters; at the moment, the team does not know anything about this, nor how to implement it, so it is hard to assess both the amount and difficulty of the workload before actually diving into it. It requires a decent amount of math and selectivity for it to function for the team’s purposes, which they will be learning along the way. The team will attempt to mitigate these risks by utilizing reference designs and validating incrementally on the FPGA."
